# Project structure

This is a monorepo. It helps share code and centralize all the work. We'r using
`npm` workspaces to manage multiple packages:

-   **vanko-api**: A REST api written with [Koa](https://koajs.com/)
-   **vanko-web**: A nextjs application
-   **vanko-types**: Shared types and schemas

You should read their respectives `README` files for more details.
